## Current Implementation Status

MollyCache is currently in **early development**. Many planned features are not yet implemented.

### Implemented Features:
- SQL Tokenizer & Parser
- Full CRUD operations (CREATE, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER)
- Transaction statements (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
- Basic table operations

### Under Current Developement:
- Full functionality for table joins
- Comprehensive parity testing with SQLite
- Performance benchmarking suite

### Roadmap:
- Row-based caching and eviction policies
- Snapshotting and persistence
- Concurrent read operations

## Core Design Philosophy

1. **Performance**: MollyCache aims to be significantly more performant than traditional disk-based SQL databases (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite) with performance comparable to in-memory cache stores (Memcached, Redis).
2. **In-Memory First**: MollyCache lives in-memory; disk I/O is only performed at direct request of the user (e.g., snapshotting).
3. **SQLite Compatibility**: MollyCache works towards complete parity with SQLiteâ€”queries should have full compatibility and produce the same results.
4. **High Test Coverage**: MollyCache maintains a test coverage goal of >75%.
5. **Zero Dependencies**: MollyCache remains dependency-free, using only Rust standard library functions.

## Planned Features

### 1. **Row-Based Caching**
MollyCache's primary use case is to function as an intelligent query cache. Unlike traditional query caches that store complete query results, MollyCache caches and evicts individual rows in its in-memory database.

**Why row-based caching?** Many queries exist as subsets of one or more other queries.

**Example scenario:**
- Product preview page loads: `SELECT id, name, price FROM products ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;`
- User hovers over products: `SELECT image, colors FROM products WHERE id IN (123, 124, 125);`
- User clicks a product: `SELECT name, image, price, colors FROM products WHERE id = 123;`

In a traditional query cache, these would be stored as three separate objects despite the third query's results being a subset of the first two. With MollyCache, the results of the first and second queries would be cached as rows, making the third query a cache hit.


### 2. **Snapshotting**
Complete parity with SQLite allows you to load schemas and data from SQLite databases to use as a data source, with configurable snapshot backup intervals and fetch intervals.

### 3. **Concurrent Reads**
The entire database is built to be atomic and thread-safe, allowing for concurrent reads. Forking is also supported at the risk of loss of data synchronization between forks.
